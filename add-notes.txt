to push a file to git you need the following commands $ git push -u origin master
you also need to link your local git to a git hub repository to do so you need to add $ git remote add origin https:://github.com/Lion-Ga92/sample_git.git
please remember to link the git hub ripositories first after initializing an empty local git.
to do so you need to first init in your terminal
create the file and work on it. add to staging and then commit before moving to git hub where you can create a new ripository and then after choosing the safety measures you can copy and paste the commands to link and push your committed file to the git hub rip
